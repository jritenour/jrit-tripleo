My personal config for deploying OpenStack using Director/TripleO

This is what I used to deploy a basic (one controller + one compute) OpenStack environment in my home lab. Will play around with doing more nodes + Ceph later when I get more disks.  For now this repo is mostly in case I need to rebuild/redeploy Director, or to try it with upstream TripleO/OSP.
